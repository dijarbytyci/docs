Tutorial Application
====================

This section of the documentation will step you through the `tutorial application`_ to demonstrate
the various concepts explained the previous sections. The tutorial application will step you through
a basic MVC application with some simple CRUD functionality using a small SQLite database. Contained
within the application is a demonstration of both a web-based and cli-based application.

There is also a more stripped down and traditional `skeleton application`_ that you can install via
composer or from GitHub if you are looking for more of a basic foundation on which to begin coding
your application using Pop.
