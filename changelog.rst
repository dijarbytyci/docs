**Migrating from Pop PHP 2.1.x to 3.0.0**

New Features
------------

* The Cache component now supports Redis and Session adapters.

Changed Features
----------------

* The Record sub-component of the Db component has been refactored.
  Functionality with this should remain largely the same, but there

  extensions, the APC adapter in the `pop-cache` component may not
  function properly in PHP 7.

  extensions, the Memcache & Memcached adapters in the `pop-cache`
  component may not function properly in PHP 7

  sub-components have been ported into their own individual components
  respectively.
