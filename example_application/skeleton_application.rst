Skeleton Application
====================

You can get a copy of the Pop PHP Framework skeleton application over on `Github`_. Or you can
install via composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer create-project popphp/popphp-skeleton project-folder

This example application will step you through a basic MVC application with some simple
CRUD functionality using a small SQLite database. Contained within the application is a
demonstration of both a web-based and cli-based application.
