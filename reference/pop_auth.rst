Pop\\Auth
=========

The `popphp/pop-auth` component is an authentication component that provides different adapters
to authenticate a user's identity. It is not to be confused with the ACL component, as that deals
with user roles and access to certain resources and not authenticating user identity.

Installation
------------

Install it directly into your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require popphp/pop-auth

Or, include it in your composer.json file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "popphp/pop-auth": "2.0.*",
        }
    }
