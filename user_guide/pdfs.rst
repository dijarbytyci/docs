PDFs
====

PDF generation in a web application is typically a required feature for any application that
does any type of in-depth reporting or data exporting. Many applications may require this
exported data to be in a concise, well-formatted and portable document and PDF provides this.

The PDF specification, as well as its shared assets' specifications, such as fonts and images,
are an extremely large and vast set. This component attempts to harness the power and features
defined by those specifications and present an intuitive API that puts the power of PDF at
your fingertips.
